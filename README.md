# WineQuality
A project on classifying into high and low quality based on chemical features.

# Wine Quality Prediction With Supervised Learning
## Introduction

In this study, we use a dataset from the University of California, Irvine, containing chemical features of different types of Vinho Verde from the north of Portugal. It also includes a quality score between 0 and 10. The data is divided into two files: one for red wines and one for white wines. For this study, we combine the two and attempt to classify the "high" quality wines from the "low" quality wines.

We will use various supervised learning models to find the best model to predict “high” and “low” quality wines based on their chemical features.

The main steps of our analysis include:

1.	Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure its quality and consistency.

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and understanding the distribution and relationships of the features.

3.	Baseline Modeling: Implementing and evaluating initial models using various supervised machine learning algorithms with default hyperparameters.

4.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the models to improve their performance.

5.	Results: Comparing the different models used and analyzing the results of the best model found.
